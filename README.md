# eGreenHouse

eGreenhouse is a lightweight and low-cost greenhouse sensor package integrated with the OPEnS HyperRail. The sensors travel through the greenhouse and transmit a live stream of data to Google Sheets.

Check out the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/eGreenHouse/wiki) or [OPEnS-Lab-Home-Page](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/OPEnS-Lab-Home/wiki/eGreenhouse). 
I would recommend checking out both links to get the idea.
